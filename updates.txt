- put feature that will ask farmer about their farm (ask the type of crop, and let ai compute how long will it take to be harvest, when the time comes app should ask after if he's harvesting of harvest complete) (should show it on map when user click on his location and click "farmer status").


UPDATE:2.1
-also why the map using wrong location it should use the device location and put user's location when signing in put the user's device location as default address unless he edit it
-Add more selections for seeds/seedlings and Fertilizers&soil (make it sectioned)
-in "edit profile and picture direct the user to user's gallery or camera
- Online tab is still empty (put list of online users)
- the ai helper "Plant Identification" and "Disease Detection" only says "Plant identification feature coming soon!" (should use real ai using user's camera and gallery)
- the ask ai is gone (put it back using real Ai)
- make shopping cart and notification icon usable
- overall make it real and fully functioning webapp
